    Photos Photo Manager
    ----------------------
    
  * Introduction
    
    Photos is a digital photo manager designed for the Pantheon desktop
    environment.  It allows you to import photos from disk or camera,
    organize them in various ways, view them in full-window or fullscreen
    mode, and export them to share with others.

    Photos' development and to make sure you're running the latest version.
    

  * Installation & Licensing
    
    Please consult the INSTALL and COPYING files for more information.
    

  * Quick Start
    
    There are three ways to import photos: via drag-and-drop, from a digital
    camera, and from the File menu.
    
    * Drag-and-drop: Simply drag photos from your file manager and drop them
    onto the Photos window.  You may drag files or directories.  The photos
    will be imported into the library.
    
    * Camera: Connect your digital camera to your computer.  Photos will 
    detect it and list it in the sidebar.  When you select the camera, Photos 
    will load previews of each photo.  You may choose specific photos to 
    import or to import them all.
    
    Photos uses gPhoto to communicate with digital cameras.  If your camera 
    does not appear in Photos' sidebar or there is a problem importing
    photos, visit http://www.gphoto.org to see if it is supported.
    
    * Open the Menu: click Import From Folder ... and select a directory
    from the chooser dialog box.  Photos will scan the directory and all
    sub-directories for photo files and automatically import them.
    
    Once your photos are in Photos' library, you can view, edit, and export
    them.  More features are planned.
