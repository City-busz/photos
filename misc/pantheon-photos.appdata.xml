      Photos is an easy-to-use, fast photo organizer. It allows you to import
      photos from your camera or disk, organize them by date and subject matter,
      even ratings. It also offers basic photo editing, like crop, red-eye correction,
      color adjustments, and straighten. Photos' non-destructive photo editor does
      not alter your master photos, making it easy to experiment and correct errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photos supports JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and a variety of RAW file formats.
